### Getting results from an API instead of entering manually
- PCS & Firstcycling: Don't have usable CORS (could use CORS anywhere)
- https://sportradar.us/2017/08/announcing-new-cycling-api/ - not free

### Todo?
- remove more acutes etc. from rider names
- compress results page url parameters. I haven't found a compression significant enough to justify the obfuscation of the url. I could also encode it more efficiently, eg `?Julian+Alaphilippe|Wout+Van+Aert|Marc+Hirschi|Michal+Kwiatkowski|Jakob+Fuglsang|Primoz+Roglic|Michael+Matthews|Alejandro+Valverde|Maximilian+Schachmann|Damiano+Caruso|izsgs1`
